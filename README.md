# Comment_Positivity_Analzer

This program uses Natural Language Processing to detect if the comment
left by a customer is positive or not 

Can run this on any IDE that can run python 

Required installation of nltk via "pip install nltk" in the terminal

In the future I am going to apply this with one of google's API's to 
stop negative comments from getting through to the owner of businesses
